- Added Crate build date column to version_info in benchmark result table

2016-07-04 0.6.0
================

Breaking
--------

- ``hosts`` and ``table`` is now always a named argument.
  This affects ``timeit``, ``insert-json``, ``insert-blob`` and
  ``insert-fake-data``


Features üçí
-----------

run-track
~~~~~~~~~

Added a new ``run-track`` command.
This command can be used to execute ``track`` files. A ``track`` file is a file
in ``TOML`` format containing a matrix definition of Crate versions, Crate
configurations and spec files.

The command will run each listed Crate version with each configuration and run
all listed spec files against it.


Other improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a new ``run-crate`` command.

- Added a fake-data provider for ``geo_point`` columns.

- Improved the ``--help`` output of most commands.

- Run-spec output is now proper JSON

- Spec files can be written in python

- ``args`` and ``bulk_args`` can now be specified in ``toml`` spec files.


Fixes üí©
--------

- ``runtime_stats['n']`` is no longer capped to 1000

- ``insert-json`` now ignores empty lines instead of causing an error.


2016-06-09 0.5.0
================

Breaking üíî
-----------

Pretty much everything:

- Renamed ``blob upload`` to ``insert-blob``

- Renamed ``json2insert`` to ``insert-json``

- Renamed ``fill-table`` to ``insert-fake-data``

- Removed ``find-perf-regressions``

New & shiny features ‚ú®
-----------------------

run-spec
~~~~~~~~

Added a new command which can be used to "run" spec files. Spec files are
either ``.json`` or ``.toml`` files which contain setup, queries and tear-down
directives. A minimal example::

    [setup]
    statement_files = ["sql/create_countries.sql"]

        [[setup.data_files]]
        target = "countries"
        source = "data/countries.json" # paths are relative to the spec file

    [[queries]]
    statement = "select count(*) from countries"
    iterations = 1000

    [teardown]
    statements = ["drop table countries"]


``run-spec`` will execute the given specification and output runtime statistics.
The result can also directly be inserted into a Crate cluster.

insert-fake-data & insert-json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Column names are now quoted in the insert statement

insert-fake-data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- No longer tries to generate data for generated columns

- Speed improvements

- Added default provider mappings for columns of type ``float``, ``double`` and
  ``ip``

insert-json
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Prints runtime stats after the inserts are finished

timeit
~~~~~~

- Added a histogram and percentiles to the runtime statistics that are printed

- Added a concurrency option


2016-05-19 0.4.0
================

- Python 3.4 support has been dropped.

- Subcommands that take numbers as arguments now support python literal
  notation. So something like ``1e3`` can be used.

Features
--------

fill-table
~~~~~~~~~~

- Consumes less memory and is faster since it no longer generates all data
  upfront but starts inserting as soon as possible.

- Added a concurrency option to control how many requests to make in parallel
  (at most).

- Columns of type long are automatically mapped to the ``random_int``
  provider.

json2insert
~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``json2insert`` can now be used to bulk insert JSON files.
  The following input formats are supported::

    1 JSON object per line

        {"name": "n1"}
        {"name": "n2"}

    Or 1 JSON object:

        {
            "name": "n1"
        }

    Or a list of JSON objects:

        [
            {"name": "n1"},
            {"name": "n2"},
        ]

  The input must be fed into ``stdin``.

- The ``--bulk-size`` and ``--concurrency`` options have been added.
